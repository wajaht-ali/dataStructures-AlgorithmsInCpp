Suppose that we have numbers between 1 and 100 in a binary search tree and we want to search for the number 15. Which of the following sequences could not be the sequence of nodes examined ?


[97, 27, 12, 24, 16, 14, 15]
[12, 39, 27, 20, 16, 14, 15]
[65, 8, 54, 37, 6, 15]
[81, 68, 11, 56, 38, 14, 29, 24, 18, 17, 16, 15]

Mode MEan Median
M = [95, 94, 5, 95, 'N']

What is the value of N if the mode, mean and median of the list M are equal to each other? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.

Note:
The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often.
The mean is the average of the numbers: a calculated "central" value of a set of numbers.
Median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers.
